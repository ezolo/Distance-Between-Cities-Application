# Distance-Between-Cities-Application
The following application calculates the distance between two cities using coordinates. When the user opens the program, a menu will be displayed with four items: enter city information, calculate distance, print all cities, and quit. When the user chooses the first option--enter city-- they will be prompted to write the city name and its coordinates. When the user chooses the second option--calculate distance-- the user, after inputting at least two cities, will be prompted to list two cities they have entered, to which the program will respond by calculating their distance. When the user chooses the third option--print all cities-- they will be given a list of all the cities they have entered. And lastly, when the user chooses the fourth option--quit-- they will promptly exit the program.
